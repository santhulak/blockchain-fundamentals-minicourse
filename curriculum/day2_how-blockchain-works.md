# Day 2: How Blockchain Works

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand block structure and hashing.
- Learn how consensus mechanisms work.

## 📖 Lesson
Each block contains:
- Data
- Hash
- Previous Hash

When a block is modified, its hash changes, breaking the chain.

### Consensus Mechanisms
- Proof of Work (PoW): Mining requires solving puzzles.
- Proof of Stake (PoS): Validators are chosen by stake.

## 🧩 Activity

## 🧠 Quiz
1. What is a hash in blockchain?
2. Define Proof of Work.
3. Why does tampering break the blockchain?
